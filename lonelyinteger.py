# There are N integers in an array A. All but one integer occurs in pairs. Your task is to find out that number that occurs only once.

# Input Format

# The first line of the input contains an integer N indicating N integers in the array A. Next line contains N integers each separated by a single space.

# Constraints

# 1 <= N < 100
# N % 2 = 1 ( N is an odd number )
# 0 <= A[i] <= 100, âˆ€ i âˆˆ [1, N]

# Output Format

# Output (S) which is the number that occurs only once.

# Sample Input:
# 3
# 1 1 2

# Sample Output:
# 2
